# Cricket Analysis

## Hey there, cricket fans! 🏏

Welcome to my Cricket Analysis project! If you love diving deep into cricket stats and uncovering hidden patterns in the game, you're in the right place. This repo is all about exploring One Day International (ODI) cricket matches using SQL and structured datasets. 

## What’s Inside?
Here’s what you’ll find in this project:
- **SQL Views** that neatly organize batting and bowling records
- **Stored Procedures** to quickly pull up match and player stats
- **Clean & Structured Data** covering matches, players, and performances
- **Easy-to-Run Queries** for getting insights into team and player trends

## The Data 📊
The datasets in this repo include:
- `odi_Batting_Card.csv` – All the batting stats you need
- `odi_Bowling_Card.csv` – Bowling performances in detail
- `odi_Matches_Data.csv` – A complete record of ODI matches
- `players_info.csv` – Essential info on all players

## How It Works 🔍
I’ve included SQL scripts that create views and stored procedures to make it super easy to analyze the data:

### Views (Pre-structured Data for Easy Access)
- `batting_records_view.sql` – Pulls out batting records neatly
- `bowling_records_view.sql` – Does the same for bowling records

### Stored Procedures (Quick Data Fetching)
- `getmatchstats_storedprocedure.sql` – Get stats for a specific match
- `getoverallstats_storedprocedure.sql` – Fetch overall stats easily

## How You Can Use It 🚀
1. Load the datasets into your favorite SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
2. Run the SQL scripts to set up the views and stored procedures.
3. Start running queries and see the magic happen!

## What’s Next?
Here’s what I’m thinking of adding:
- Cool visualizations to make stats more exciting 🎨📊
- A dashboard to make it more user-friendly
- Maybe some AI-powered predictions for future matches? 🤖
